1
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,686
I don't want you to think
of this as just a film...

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,294
...some process of converting
electrons and magnetic impulses...

3
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,520
...into shapes and figures
and sounds.

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,665
No. Listen to me.

5
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,666
We're here to make
a dent in the universe.

6
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,963
Otherwise, why even be here?

7
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,664
We're creating a completely
new consciousness...

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,571
...like an artist or a poet.

9
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,575
That's how you have to think of this.

10
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,909
We're rewriting the history of human
thought with what we're doing.

11
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,574
Right. Well, Steven, at the moment
I'm more worried...

12
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,483
...about getting light on the actress.
You know what I mean?

13
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,125
Simon. Excuse me a second.

14
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,467
- Michelle.
- Yeah?

15
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,195
Michelle, walk...
Yes, walk towards lens slowly.

16
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,032
Like this?

17
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,799
Okay. Right. Right.

18
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,514
<i>I always wondered what it
must have been like for Steve. </i>

19
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,387
I mean, ever since we were kids,
everything he ever did...

20
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,224
...was somewhere between a religious
experience and some sort of crusade.

21
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,795
<i>Like with this commercial. </i>

22
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,299
<i>It was practically a legend
from the time Ridley Scott filmed it. </i>

23
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,132
<i>Like the book, 1984,
with all the downtrodden masses... </i>

24
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,797
<i>... and that one huge spark
of rebellion... </i>

25
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:52,240
<i>... against the evil Big Brother
who ran everything. </i>

26
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,946
Go, go, go.

27
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,713
Smoke it up, please.

28
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,948
And you three.
That's right, you'll come with me.

29
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,555
The rest of you stay in the back.

30
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:23,341
<i>- is a more powerful weapon
than any fleet or army on Earth. </i>

31
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,002
<i>We are one people with one will. </i>

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,513
<i>One resolve. One cause. </i>

33
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,241
<i>Our enemies shall talk
themselves to death... </i>

34
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,015
<i>... and we will bury them
with their own confusion. </i>

35
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,456
<i>We shall prevail. </i>

36
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,531
<i>And then 13 years later... </i>

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,897
<i>... Steve has to stand up
on that stage in Boston. </i>

38
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,560
<i>Man, that was... </i>

39
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,434
<i>That was weird. </i>

40
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,705
The era...

41
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,936
...of competition between us is over.

42
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,046
Thank you, Bill.

43
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,576
Thank you for standing with us.

44
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,221
The world's a better place
because of it.

45
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,914
Microsoft is gonna ruin Apple.
You can't trust them.

46
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,581
I know.

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,459
I realize that this news
may be shocking to some of you.

48
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,997
<i>I mean,
Steve talking to Bill Gates... </i>

49
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,193
<i>... who's staring down
like he's Big Brother, and he was. </i>

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,066
<i>For years, Steve almost went crazy
over what Bill was doing to him... </i>

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,175
<i>... and now he's up there on that stage,
in front of the world... </i>

52
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,278
<i>... telling everybody he's practically
the Second Coming. </i>

53
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,772
<i>I mean, how do you get
from there to here?</i>

54
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,854
<i>There was a disturbance
on the campus... </i>

55
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,555
<i>... of the University
of California at Berkeley. </i>

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,790
<i>The Santa Barbara campus
reported a small-scale riot as well. </i>

57
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,800
<i>- The demonstrators said they were...
- More than 400 students... </i>

58
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,438
<i>... have taken part
in the demonstration. </i>

59
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,508
<i>In the morning, police began launching
tear-gas grenades to break up the crowd. </i>

60
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,613
<i>Student leaders are anxious
to meet with university officials... </i>

61
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,681
<i>... to express their views on Vietnam. </i>

62
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,111
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Let's get out of here.

63
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,155
Stay back. Hold it.
Hold it there. Get back.

64
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,080
- Don't drop the box!
- I'm not!

65
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,725
Come on.

66
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,361
You okay?

67
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,833
Those guys think
they're revolutionaries.

68
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,737
- They're not. We are.
- We are?

69
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,211
<i>You know, Steve was
never like you or me. </i>

70
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,678
<i>He always saw things differently. 
Even then when I was in Berkeley... </i>

71
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,875
<i>... I'd see something and just see
kilobytes or circuit boards... </i>

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,079
<i>... while he'd see karma or the meaning
of the universe. </i>

73
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,688
<i>Steve and I found this weird guy
who was a hero around Berkeley... </i>

74
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,091
<i>... all because he found a way
to beat the system. </i>

75
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,198
<i>This guy was called Captain Crunch... </i>

76
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,995
...because he figured out
this little whistle...

77
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,604
...that you found in boxes
of Cap'n Crunch cereal...

78
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,969
...had the same tones as AT&T's
long-distance equipment.

79
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,343
<i>So you got free phone calls
anywhere in the world... </i>

80
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,878
<i>... with this thing I built
called the blue box. </i>

81
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,175
<i>And then we tested it out
by calling the pope. </i>

82
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,682
- You talk to him.
- No, no, no.

83
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,683
They're putting you
through to the pope?

84
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,322
I totally figured it out, man.

85
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,226
I figured it out. I know what it's about.
You know what it's about?

86
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,395
It's about power.

87
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,327
Right on, man.

88
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,259
It's like those weird countries...

89
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,096
...where the army guys
overthrow the president.

90
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,295
The first thing that they take over...

91
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,933
...are the ways people communicate,
you know, radio, TV, newspapers.

92
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,842
Far-out, man.

93
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,610
Information is power.

94
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,512
<i>I kept building the boxes,
and Steve kept selling them... </i>

95
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,316
<i>... until one day, we almost
got busted by some cops... </i>

96
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,188
<i>... who, thank God, didn't even
know what a blue box was. </i>

97
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,261
You might wanna try a haircut, boys.

98
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,733
<i>So I started trying to build something
that wasn't gonna get us in trouble. </i>

99
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,365
- That's not a blue box.
- It's a computer.

100
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,065
Woz, we need blue boxes,
not computers.

101
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,212
<i>- I got a reporter from Mercury News coming.
- What for?</i>

102
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,315
My mom phoned, told them I was building
a computer, and they wanna do a story.

103
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,041
Woz, give me a break.

104
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,654
Hey, let me ask you something,
seriously. Look at me.

105
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,882
Do you wanna get stuck here
the rest of your life in this hellhole?

106
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,152
Look, this is where I grew up, okay?
It's not a hellhole. Shoot.

107
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,126
I know your newspaper will find
Steve's computer fascinating.

108
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,698
He's so ingenious.
He built it all from spare parts.

109
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,425
Steven, the reporter is...

110
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,002
Hi. It caught fire.

111
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,132
My first chance at fame,
and the computer catches fire.

112
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,278
Sorry.

113
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,683
<i>When I was still at Berkeley... </i>

114
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,842
<i>... I kept making
weird electronic gadgets... </i>

115
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,648
<i>... that were basically just jokes. </i>

116
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,923
<i>But, hey, you know, jokes are important. </i>

117
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,225
<i>The problem back then was
me and Steve and his girlfriend... </i>

118
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,630
<i>... were pretty much broke. </i>

119
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,671
<i>So we ended up doing some pretty
nutty things just to make money. </i>

120
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,433
I know where we can get a job.

121
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,237
- Saw it on the bulletin board there.
- What kind of job?

122
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,937
I don't know. It seems
sort of like show business.

123
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,715
<i>Dressing up as Alice in Wonderland
and stuff for a bunch of kids?</i>

124
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,458
<i>But, you know, Steve wasn't
exactly cut out for that stuff. </i>

125
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,459
Maybe in a past life...

126
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,363
...I was a poet or an artist.

127
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,529
You know, maybe you talk about
past lives and all that stuff...

128
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,766
...because, well,
you don't know who you are.

129
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,778
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't know who I am?

130
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,477
Well, you don't.
I mean, you told me...

131
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,083
I don't wanna talk about it
with you or anyone else.

132
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,419
I'm just trying to help.

133
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,554
It wasn't like Steve and I
lost touch with each other...

134
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,960
...but he was definitely
in places I wasn't...

135
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,091
...like some ashram in India...

136
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,795
...and communes up in Oregon
where they picked apples all day.

137
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,138
<i>It was pretty much
of a journey for Steve. </i>

138
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,276
<i>The kind that's as much
on the inside as on the outside. </i>

139
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,106
<i>I mean, he definitely must
have been to weird places. </i>

140
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,347
See the new Playmate?
Miss October?

141
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,520
Hey, man, Miss August is way better.

142
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,424
Boobs out to here.

143
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,794
Honest to God, Ballmer.
You have no culture.

144
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,336
Yeah, right.
Like you go around reading Plato.

145
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,805
You're the only guy I know...

146
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,772
<i>...who could make furniture
out of Playboys, for God sakes.</i>

147
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,174
Look, you got enough
to make a chair.

148
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,571
You don't have to worry
about them moving...

149
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,773
...because they're stuck together.
- Get out.

150
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,351
<i>- They're all stuck together.
- Sometimes back then... </i>

151
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,112
<i>... I could've throttled Bill Gates. </i>

152
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,121
The guy could turn any human situation
into a poker game.

153
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,225
Forget about classes. Poker.

154
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,191
The fact that the world might
end tonight? No problem, poker.

155
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,264
Or we're finally deciphering
the meaning of life.

156
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,730
More poker.

157
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,028
<i>And winning. The guy'd have
a hairball if he'd lost... </i>

158
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,000
<i>... which wasn't often,
let me tell you. </i>

159
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,504
- Full house.
- Oh, man.

160
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,400
Hey, Bill.

161
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,305
<i>Our rooms were like a casino. </i>

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,643
<i>Actually, a messy casino. </i>

163
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,081
<i>And Bill slept wherever he fell down. </i>

164
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,157
Bill, the revolution's starting
without us.

165
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,296
<i>Bill and Paul Allen had known
each other since they were kids. </i>

166
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,694
<i>If the word "passion"
entered into their lives... </i>

167
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,993
<i>... it was for one thing: Computers. </i>

168
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,002
<i>Especially this one made by some guy
in Albuquerque of all places. </i>

169
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,598
What is this, porn for engineers?

170
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,838
Oh, jeez, the Altair.

171
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,108
Am I missing something?

172
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,081
I mean, Miss October, I can understand,
but what is this?

173
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,986
This is better than Miss October.

174
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,985
This is a computer.

175
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,251
- Oh, God.
- The article says...

176
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,191
...that they need someone
to figure out a language for it.

177
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,389
Right now
it just sits there and blinks.

178
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,765
Whoever talks to this Ed Roberts
has gotta go to Albuquerque to see him.

179
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,966
You should go because you look
better for that stuff than I do.

180
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,445
- I do not.
- You both look terrible.

181
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,047
- Just get used to it.
- What are we supposed to do?

182
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,241
It's simple.
You call him and say you're Paul.

183
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,979
And then Paul goes to Albuquerque
and says he's Paul.

184
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,229
So, what are you gonna say?

185
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,692
Hi, Mr. Ed Roberts, please.

186
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,768
This is Paul Allen, calling
from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

187
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,007
It's our job to find out what this guy
doesn't know that he needs...

188
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,173
...but does need and make sure
he knows he does need it...

189
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,872
...and that we're the only ones
to give him the answer.

190
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,540
What?

191
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,345
- Mr. Roberts?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Allen.

192
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,323
I tell you, I believe that we've
got one hot product here.

193
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,930
The reason I can speak that way is
because I've taken over 50 calls...

194
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,295
...from people wanting to come to
work with us on this Altair project.

195
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,894
So here's the deal.

196
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,597
I snuck two women into my room.

197
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,941
And they're naked.

198
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,511
I mean, like, really naked.

199
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,548
You know, like, gorgeous naked.

200
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,943
So don't say I never
did anything for you...

201
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,919
...because they're waiting
for you right now.

202
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,357
Drop dead, Ballmer.

203
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,824
Oh, and I told them...

204
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,759
...that you were writing
a computer language...

205
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,399
...and right away,
they start moaning for it.

206
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,229
"Oh, computer languages.

207
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,768
Oh, Fortran.

208
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,907
Oh, Fortran. "

209
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,334
Will you cut it out, Steve.

210
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,812
Excuse me, I'm just trying
to save you guys from...

211
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,217
...wasting your entire
Harvard reading week...

212
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,378
...over this Traf-O-Data simulator...

213
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,652
...while everyone else
is out getting drunk or laid.

214
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,455
- Paul, are those parts binary?
- I give up. I give up.

215
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,223
I give up. I give up.

216
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,235
Oh, duck, Bill.

217
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,750
Oh, you know, Bill, I think you gotta
come up with a better pickup line.

218
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,979
Asking her what her SAT score is
is definitely not gonna do it.

219
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,087
I forgot to write a loader.

220
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,055
That's not an improvement, Bill.

221
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,388
No, no. I just realized something.
Paul's on his way to Albuquerque.

222
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,726
I forgot to write the loader that connects
the computer to the Teletype.

223
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,400
<i>And if he starts that machine,
and it can't read the tape, we're dead. </i>

224
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,273
Unless he did it on the plane,
I'm finished.

225
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,742
- It's something I just realized.
- I hope so.

226
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,106
If this Albuquerque thing had worked,
I was gonna quit Harvard.

227
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,841
Are you crazy?

228
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,453
I gotta be a doctor or something.

229
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,158
Gynecologist, maybe.

230
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,256
- Come on.
- I'm flying.

231
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,226
Yeah, you're flying.

232
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,090
- Here we go.
- Ballmer.

233
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,335
You're the only guy I know
who pays the strippers...

234
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,472
...to put their clothes on.

235
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,836
Come on, drunkie.

236
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,183
Okay.

237
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,588
Hey, Bill...

238
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,089
...it's either the clothes or you,
but something...

239
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,022
...definitely needs to be hosed down.

240
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,991
- Sorry we failed.
- Come on.

241
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,096
- Good night.
- Sorry we failed.

242
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,304
<i>Bill, Bill, Bill. </i>

243
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,638
<i>Bill, Bill, Bill. </i>

244
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,947
It's an Altair.

245
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,058
They gave it to us as a gift.

246
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,420
We blew them away.

247
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,829
Woz, do we have to have mice?

248
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,097
Come on, I like mice. This is Irving.

249
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,434
Hey, man, you are putting poison
into your body.

250
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,473
Hey, hey, come on.
Give me those.

251
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,169
- That's french fries, man.
- That's what I mean.

252
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,578
French fries, all-American food.
Come on.

253
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,684
I can't eat like you do.

254
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,252
Eating fruit all the time.
That's weird.

255
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,351
It's not weird. It's pure.
Makes the soul pure.

256
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,928
Oh, wait, wait. You gotta listen to this.
I got a great one today.

257
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,295
<i>Did you hear about the drunk who
came staggering out of the subway... </i>

258
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,301
<i>... and said, "Man, I got lost
in some guy's basement. </i>

259
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,531
<i>You should've seen the set
of trains he had"?</i>

260
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,144
<i>- the Bay Area Dial-a-Joke Line,
making your day a barrel of laughs. </i>

261
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,906
I got a new book of Polish jokes.

262
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,107
Man, it'll keep me going for years.

263
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,275
- Why?
- Why?

264
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,478
It makes people laugh.

265
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:07,318
I got people phoning in every day
just to hear my latest joke.

266
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,721
It makes their day better.

267
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,855
Are you sure this thing's
gonna work?

268
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,225
- Lf it doesn't catch fire.
- Don't even joke.

269
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,696
I like jokes.

270
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,963
Jokes make me feel good.

271
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,574
You know, I hired
a private detective today.

272
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,176
I wanna find my mother.

273
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,985
My real mother.

274
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,419
You never talk about that stuff
with me.

275
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,484
That part about being adopted and all.

276
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,027
Guy says he can probably find her.

277
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,865
Why do you always get freaked
out when Arlene asks about it?

278
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,832
Arlene? Arlene's got her own problems.

279
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:56,338
My parents don't want her in the house.
She phones me a million times a day.

280
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,140
At least I'm working on my stuff.

281
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,752
Feel better?

282
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,865
Now, Steve, tell the others
what you're feeling.

283
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,267
Like...

284
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,769
- Like it's gone.
- What is?

285
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,238
The anger.

286
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,340
Like the anger's gone.

287
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,675
It's gone.

288
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,266
<i>Back then, our big thrill was going to
this thing they called the Homebrew Club. </i>

289
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,566
<i>It was where guys
spent all their spare time... </i>

290
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,938
<i>... trying to get access to computers
owned by the local corporations. </i>

291
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,171
<i>And people would go there
and show the stuff they just built. </i>

292
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,839
<i>Except most of it
didn't really work all that well. </i>

293
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,783
<i>- Read in the Popular Electronics
issue about a year ago...</i>

295
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,554
<i>I was nervous that day we walked

- What is this thing?
- Check it out.

00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,907
The first computer
you're ever gonna see.

301
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,474
What's the screen for?

302
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,169
<i>I was never good at talking

304
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,709
Alexander Graham Bell when he heard his
first ring, that's as revolutionary as this is.

305
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,516
He's talking about the Altair? I never
had a problem till I tried to use it.

306
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,252
<i>All of a sudden we found out what
we wanted to do with our lives. </i>

307
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,828
<i>- It was all we ever wanted. 
- To 30.</i>

308
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,057
Here is the first personal computer
that you're gonna wanna buy.

309
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,235
Man, 50! We sold 50.

310
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,400
IBM is gonna be
loading in their pants.

311
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,512
I don't even think
IBM knows who we are.

312
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,046
Good. This is guerrilla warfare.

313
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,912
- They're the enemy.
- They are?

314
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:24,317
I used to think maybe Steve was
born obsessed with wiping out IBM.

315
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,956
And in a way, you could see why.

316
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,649
I mean, in those days,
as far as we were concerned...

317
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,193
...IBM was practically
like the Pentagon.

318
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,062
<i>Here were a bunch of guys
who dressed exactly the same... </i>

319
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,532
<i>... and sang company songs. </i>

320
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,942
<i>I mean, we were
these scruffy crazies... </i>

321
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:52,277
<i>... messing around with computer stuff
the IBM guys thought was, like, toys. </i>

322
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,282
<i>But what did they know?</i>

323
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,224
- Where's your VW?
- Sold it.

324
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,691
1350 bucks. We're on our way.

325
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,595
- Steve.
- What?

326
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,566
- What's the problem?
- I don't know if I can build these.

327
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,707
Hey, Woz, I assume we're speaking
the same language, right?

328
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,934
Dan, Elizabeth,
I'm not speaking Swahili, am I?

329
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,508
I'm here to inform you
our universe is unfolding...

330
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,705
But I still don't think
I can build them.

331
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,611
I work for Hewlett-Packard sometimes.

332
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,513
- Yeah, and?
- My dad pointed it out...

333
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,881
...they get first chance
in anything I invent.

334
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,189
- What?
- I can't help it.

335
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,257
It's on the paper I signed.

336
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,759
Damn it, Woz!
We get our shot, our destiny...

337
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,591
...and now we gotta turn it
all over to these businessmen?

338
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,880
Steve. It is Steve, isn't it?

339
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,858
Yeah. Steve, you say
that this gadget of yours...

340
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,391
...is for ordinary people.

341
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,998
What on earth would ordinary
people want with computers?

342
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,590
What?

343
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,603
What?

344
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,077
They hated it.

345
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,274
They hated it.

346
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,109
They hated it.

347
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,142
Whenever Steve went
to a bank to get a loan...

348
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,845
...it was like they were Eskimos,
and we had a refrigerator to sell them.

349
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>Okay, so Steve didn't look
like a business guy. But who did?</i>

350
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,186
<i>Business guys and bankers thought
you'd just barfed on their shoes... </i>

351
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,799
<i>... if you tried to interest them
in computers for ordinary people. </i>

352
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,934
<i>I mean, go figure. </i>

353
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,910
Where's your beard?

354
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,014
In the bathroom. Shaved it off.

355
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,949
Well, how come?

356
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,348
Because banks don't like beards.

357
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,083
So we called ourselves Apple...

358
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,421
...and started making
those little computers.

359
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,655
Me, Steve and his friends
Elizabeth and Dan.

360
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,698
All of us sweating away
in Steve's parents' garage.

361
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,468
It's like sometimes not knowing
how crazy something is...

362
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,105
...is a good thing.

363
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,900
You're just goofing around...

364
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,374
...until someone like Mike
shows up and says, "Wow. "

365
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,241
- Steve Jobs?
- Jobs.

366
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,939
Oh, right. I'm sorry. Mike Markula.

367
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,112
- Hey, Mike. How you doing?
- I'm well.

368
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,312
The man who put intelligence
into Intel.

369
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,717
- Yeah...
- No smoking in here.

370
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,155
Oh, I'm sorry about that. Yeah.

371
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,294
- Valentine said you might call.
- Yeah.

372
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,363
- Welcome to Apple Computers.
- Thank you. Here it is, huh?

373
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,896
I was looking for a venture
opportunity like this.

374
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,702
What kind of venture money
are we talking about, Mike?

375
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,804
We start with about a quarter million
dollars and see what happens.

376
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,174
Excuse me?

377
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,044
Quarter million dollars.
You must be Steve Wozniak.

378
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,773
- Yeah.
- Mike Markula.

379
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,880
A quarter million dollars into this?

380
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,213
- Yep.
- What's the catch?

381
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,723
- No catch, just business.
- That's the catch...

382
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,552
...because this ain't just business.

383
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,954
This is practically spiritual.

384
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,189
This is about overthrowing dead culture.

385
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,597
- Dead gods.
- Okay, look.

386
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,103
You guys wanna be operating out
of a garage, that's fine with me.

387
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,707
But this is a ground-zero operation here.

388
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,401
Steve Wozniak's employee number one.
You're number two.

389
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,240
Wait a minute.

390
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,439
I'm employee number one.

391
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,778
- Woz?
- Doesn't matter to me.

392
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,387
- I'm employee number one.
- I'm not saying anything.

393
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,887
- I wasn't implying anything.
- Then I'll be zero.

394
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,822
- Woz, you can be number one.
- I'll be zero. Okay?

395
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,155
<i>Even though things
were changing like crazy... </i>

396
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,594
<i>... venture capitalists
and bankers and all that... </i>

397
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,529
<i>... some things still stayed the same,
especially with Steve. </i>

398
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,227
- I don't want it, Steve.
- It'll make you nice.

399
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,603
Woz, you and me.

400
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,572
This is your mother telling you
to drop this beautiful acid...

401
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,541
Your mother wouldn't approve either.

402
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,341
- Get that away from me. "Man. "
- Man, come on.

403
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,047
I'd be careful.

404
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,549
Baby, it's you and me.
Take a little trip?

405
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,017
- No, thanks, Steve.
- Come on.

406
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,486
- Steve, no.
- What's the matter with you guys?

407
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:10,222
It's like living with a bunch
of squares and stiffs.

408
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,358
More for me.

409
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,696
Oh, I'm standing.
I'm standing in front of something.

410
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,395
It's a field of wheat.

411
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,937
<i>Oh, and I hear classical music playing. 
Do you hear it?</i>

412
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,372
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

413
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:30,207
<i>I'm conducting classical music!</i>

414
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,054
Everything's moving with the wind.

415
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,316
Everything's moving with the wind.

416
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,802
Everything's moving
just the way I want it to.

417
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,940
Everything.

418
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,556
Steve.

419
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,060
Hey...

420
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,823
...how am I gonna get home?

421
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,672
- It's not bad when there's no wind.
- Yeah?

422
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,471
What is that?

423
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,950
Bring down a pallet with six more.

424
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,587
- Oh, man.
- What?

425
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,219
I was just thinking about Harvard.
It'll pass.

426
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,793
Hey, Paul.

427
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,959
Right on schedule.
How you doing?

428
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,867
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Ed.

429
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,066
So...

430
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,108
...are you...? Are you Bill?

431
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,507
Are you Ed?

432
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,410
Well, I'll be damned.

433
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,050
Signing bonus?

434
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,430
I've never given a signing bonus
in all my life.

435
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,797
You know, Ed, in our other contracts,
we always get a signing bonus.

436
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,996
- Other contracts?
- Yeah, our other contracts.

437
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,038
Well, I don't know.

438
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,142
I don't know.

439
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,645
Okay.

440
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,023
- Two thousand.
- Four thousand.

441
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,258
- What?
- Of course.

442
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,961
Next, Ed, this business
of a $ 15 royalty...

443
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,656
...for BASIC sold in every 4K Altair,
it's just not acceptable.

444
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,927
Let me tell you something, boy.
This ain't the way I do business.

445
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,163
And I especially don't like
being dictated to by some little...

446
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,830
Ed, Ed, this is not about dictating.

447
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,569
You see, this is about reality.

448
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:18,842
The reality is that your machine is
brilliant, but it needs our language.

449
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,043
And without it, you know,
it's just a tin box that lights up.

450
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,557
So let's double our royalty
from $ 15 to $30 a copy.

451
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,059
<i>So back then I get postcards
from these guys. </i>

452
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,467
<i>"Wish you were here," and all that. 
Yeah, right, Albuquerque. </i>

453
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,869
<i>Bill and Paul were living
in this crummy motel... </i>

454
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,671
<i>... acting like they had a clue about
being in the computer business. </i>

455
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,609
- Eureka.
- What?

456
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,875
I created a program
that can play blackjack.

457
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,048
Chris, you've been here two days,
and you're into blackjack?

458
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,916
Yeah, so?

459
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,920
So you got work to do.

460
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,357
Oh, God, no.

461
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,022
Not Frank Sinatra. Not "My Way. "

462
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,134
Not again. Spare us.

463
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,345
So, Paul, I'm putting in $909,
and you're in for 606...

464
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,347
...and we're keeping
the Microsoft name.

465
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,952
You know how you told Ed that
we're leasing whole office buildings?

466
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,386
What if he finds out
our corporate headquarters...

467
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,322
...are in that roach motel
with two student employees?

468
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,563
You think they're hookers?

469
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,165
Either that or motel inspectors.

470
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,769
I saw that one going in and out
of the motel room...

471
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,168
...about a dozen times yesterday.

472
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,872
Oh, baby.

473
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,615
- I quit Harvard for this?
- You wanted glamour.

474
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,587
- You got glamour.
- Come on, baby.

475
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:12,092
Quit bitching
or else go get us that pizza.

476
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,364
Oh, yeah.

477
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,171
Oh, baby, come on. Yes!

478
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:09,376
Rise and shine. Wakey wakey.
Your 9:30's here.

479
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,250
You left your MasterCard
in the restaurant again yesterday.

480
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,790
That's the third time this month.
The hotel in Dallas called and said...

481
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,554
...you left your suit in the room
when you checked out.

482
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,757
Hertz called back and said
they will never rent you a car again.

483
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,903
Two more speeding citations in the mail
and wash your hair.

484
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,597
No, comb your hair, wash it later
and change your shirt.

485
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,274
It's over there.

486
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,581
We're here for our 9:30
with your president, Mr. Gates.

487
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,321
Mr...

488
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,795
...Gates?

489
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,567
Hello?

490
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,074
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Paul left a message. He said to tell you...

491
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,737
...if you get thrown in jail again tonight,
you're on your own.

492
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,248
You have to find somebody else
to bail you out.

493
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,216
Okay?

494
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:23,984
- Jeez, Bill, isn't this Paul's car?
- You know, I figured it out.

495
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,189
Exercise is bad for your health.

496
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,358
You see, if you take a normal pulse rate,
70 per minute...

497
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,028
...times the average life span,
which is 75 years...

498
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,333
- Too fast, Bill. Please.
- Let's see, that's...

499
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,607
...70 times 60 minutes,
times 24 hours, times 365 days.

500
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,078
- Come on, please.
- That's 37 million heartbeats...

501
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,648
...times 75 years.

502
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,046
Slow down.

503
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,558
Hey, Chris. Take a look.

504
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,700
Bill.

505
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,292
No way, man.

506
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,305
Bill.

507
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,174
The keys are in it.

508
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,504
I don't know if this
is such a good idea, Bill.

509
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,910
Can you get off that thing? Come on.

510
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,678
I think you steer with the pedals
and these levers.

511
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,651
No, Bill. Come on. Please.

512
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,056
- Okay, don't worry about it.
- Yeah, right.

513
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,886
On your mark.

514
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,184
Get set.

515
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,227
Go.

516
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,632
You're going down.

517
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,879
No way, man.

518
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,448
<i>Microsoft?
Nobody I knew ever heard of Microsoft... </i>

519
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,953
<i>... or Bill Gates. 
I mean, they were nobodies. </i>

520
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,718
But then we were all nobodies,
which was perfect for us...

521
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,692
...because all the respectable,
straight-arrow guys...

522
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,889
...were busy doing what they always do,
which is be respectable...

523
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:12,263
<i>... which meant the rest of us
could run around acting like crazies... </i>

524
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,768
<i>... which is what we did best. </i>

525
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,702
<i>I miss those days. </i>

526
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,979
A bulldozer?

527
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,810
Who's this Apple Computer?

528
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,214
You hit my car with a bulldozer, Bill?

529
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,982
I'm sorry.

530
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,215
<i>We went looking for someone who had
the kind of software we needed. </i>

531
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:38,385
<i>The only place we found was this dinky
little company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. </i>

532
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,727
It says Apple wants a contract
for $21,000 to license BASIC.

533
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,061
Do you know what this means, Paul?

534
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,569
Yeah, yeah. It means
that we're desperate for business.

535
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,503
We're nearly bankrupt, and even worse,
we're in Albuquerque.

536
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,338
I just got this car, Bill.
I don't believe you.

537
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,844
- A damn bulldozer?
- I'm sorry.

538
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,814
I think that this means there's something
really going on out there in California.

539
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:15,189
- Nine forty-five.
- A.M. Or P.M.?

540
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,835
Opens in 15 minutes.

541
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,905
I'm so tired I can't see straight.

542
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,401
What if they find out we've only made
three of these computers...

543
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,705
...and we're acting like we got
an assembly line full of the things?

544
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,940
- What then?
- Hey, Woz. No sleeping in the booth, Woz.

545
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,550
You're cluttering up the joint.

546
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,620
Steve, all of a sudden
we're working harder than our fathers...

547
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,881
...who we laughed at
for how hard they worked.

548
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,151
- I don't get it.
- Come on. Still gotta change.

549
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,555
Change what?

550
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,822
<i>Doors will open in 15 minutes. </i>

551
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,893
Oh, my God.

552
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,832
- Steve.
- What?

553
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,342
- What?
- No.

554
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:07,417
- Like I have to have a mustache?
- A suit. You actually bought a suit.

555
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,249
Two minutes to 10.

556
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:15,856
- Well, you think anyone will show up?
- How the hell should I know that?

557
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,319
Of course they're gonna show up.
I don't know. Maybe.

558
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,159
Is my tie okay?

559
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,542
There it is.

560
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:42,012
<i>Unbelievable. It was practically like
being a rock star or something. </i>

561
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,517
<i>People swarming all over you. </i>

562
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,088
<i>Hordes of them coming to see
this amazing machine... </i>

563
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,784
<i>... with 62 chips
and ICs that make all these colors. </i>

564
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:56,264
Hard plastic, molded casing.
You've never seen this.

565
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:15,449
- 65.02 and up.
- No, we got them beat.

566
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,811
<i>And when the guys
from Microsoft showed up... </i>

567
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,957
<i>... how were we to know who they were?
Them standing there... </i>

568
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,561
<i>... looking at an empty Altair booth
on one side and us on the other. </i>

569
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,220
<i>- I mean, who would you choose?
- Hi, how are you?</i>

570
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,963
- Hi.
- Steve.

571
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,660
- How you doing?
- I'm Bill Gates.

572
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,430
- Yeah, hi.
- Chairman of Microsoft.

573
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,336
- Nice to see you. We had a box...
- Microsoft, we design...

574
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,807
Yeah, good to see you.

575
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,576
- Hey, Steve. Over here.
- Hi, John.

576
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,684
Excuse me, excuse me.

577
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,190
No, wait, come here. Come here.

578
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,289
Maybe he just didn't hear you
or something.

579
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,692
Yeah, maybe.

580
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:06,428
For the first time in my life, people are
coming to me, instead of me going to them.

581
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,266
Man, this is insanely great.

582
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,322
<i>I'm telling you, it was a weird time. </i>

583
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,951
<i>People were going nuts over the Apple II.
I couldn't keep up with anything. </i>

584
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,328
<i>The company was expanding so fast I
didn't know who half the new people were. </i>

585
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,077
<i>And Steve had a lot of people,
you know, older people... </i>

586
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,584
<i>... start pay attention to him,
which was amazing. </i>

587
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,986
<i>And me too, sort of. 
People even knew who I was. </i>

588
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,591
<i>- Hi.
- Should have been fun... </i>

589
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,093
<i>... but with all the good stuff,
bad stuff came too. </i>

590
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,063
- Steve.
- What?

591
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,329
Oh, jeez. Not again.

592
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,204
What? What? What?

593
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,311
What are you...? What are you talking about,
it's not your child?

594
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,380
How do I even know if this baby's mine?

595
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,880
- You know. Damn you, you know.
- How do I know that?

596
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,884
Steve, I'm two months pregnant.
Who else have I been with?

597
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,182
Look, go do whatever it is you wanna do.
You wanna play mommy? Fine.

598
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,622
- But the kid's not mine.
- It is. It is.

599
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,659
You bastard!

600
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,824
God.

601
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,630
What did they say?

602
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,498
Hey, Steve. Take a look at this.

603
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,536
Carl's got that parity on that BASIC...

604
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:53,768
You guys are not being paid
to be a bunch of clowns!

605
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:57,107
Or maybe you are.
Maybe that's the problem around here.

606
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,909
You guys are supposed
to be writing programs.

607
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,881
Steve, we were just doing...

608
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:06,989
I need people with talent.
I need artists!

609
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:13,823
What the hell are you morons but a bunch
of clock-punching losers? Huh, tell me?

610
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:21,734
And here is another letter
of recommendation.

611
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,309
Well, Mr. Brewster,
we've looked at your application...

612
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,638
...and I see a lot
of mainframe experience here.

613
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,781
Six years. Actually...

614
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,951
Six and a half.

615
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,550
Steve? I don't know
if you've met Steve Jobs.

616
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,321
Yes. No. It's good to meet you.

617
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,522
Right.

618
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,226
You were in marketing, correct?

619
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,870
That was before the programming. Yeah.

620
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,973
I took night-school courses
at San Jos State.

621
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,132
You look like an IBM type.

622
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,239
Well...

623
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,679
...no. But I did have a chance in college
to be interviewed by them...

624
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,016
...and they liked me. They flew me out
to their headquarters Back East.

625
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,519
Oh, I'm sure they did.

626
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,890
No, I did, see?

627
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:24,398
I was one of about a dozen people
that they really recruited.

628
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,399
Are you a virgin?

629
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,134
Steve, come on.

630
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:35,168
- What? Am I what?
- Are you a virgin?

631
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,337
L...

632
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,876
No.

633
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,984
How old were you
when you first got laid?

634
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,088
I don't... I don't...

635
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,989
- Steve, will you leave him alone?
- I asked you a question.

636
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:59,327
My wife and I have been married
since we were in grad school.

637
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,734
I didn't ask you about your wife.

638
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:08,442
You're still a virgin.
You just think you're not.

639
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,142
You don't fit in here.

640
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,550
Why are you even wasting our time?

641
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,768
I...

642
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,183
Yeah, I'll run a test on it.

643
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,987
Steve...

644
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,894
...you demolished that guy.
- Woz, what we're doing right now...

645
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,934
...is like...

646
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,362
...opening doors.

647
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,234
Every day.

648
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:15,541
If you open the wrong one,
all sorts of bad things will come at you.

649
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,344
You gotta be careful
which door you open.

650
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:29,625
- You want me to go apologize to that guy?
- Well, he probably left.

651
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,994
You know, Steve, there's things
you probably have to get past with me.

652
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,862
But I'm telling you, there's things
that I have to get past with you.

653
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,162
I mean, people say stuff
about you sometimes...

654
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,931
...and I don't listen to them,
because I know you.

655
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,941
I mean, I excuse stuff
because we're friends.

656
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,371
It's worth it. It is.

657
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,244
It's worth it. It's worth it. It's worth it.

658
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,788
<i>It was about five years
after I got out of Harvard... </i>

659
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:06,520
<i>... I get this call from Bill, who says,
"You wanna join me and Paul?"</i>

660
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,530
<i>It was a two-bit little company
they called Microsoft. </i>

661
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,830
<i>And at first I think,
"Yeah. Like I'd like to lose more hair. "</i>

662
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,302
<i>But, you know, then I started thinking. </i>

663
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,168
You know how you survive?

664
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,836
You make people need you.

665
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:25,411
You survive because
you make them need what you have.

666
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,914
And then they have nowhere else to go.

667
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,491
Right now we're dead.

668
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:40,226
- Nobody needs us.
- So we make them need us?

669
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,699
We're too small even to matter.

670
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:48,201
We could be snuffed out tomorrow,
and no one would notice.

671
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,237
You know what they say in the Mafia?

672
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:56,442
You keep your friends close
but your enemies closer.

673
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,309
Which enemies are you talking about?

674
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,019
I got some full barf bags here.
Full barf bags. Heads up.

675
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,853
- He's sick.
- Bald guy with barf bags.

676
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,224
Coming through. Full ones too.
How you doing?

677
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,763
Come on.

678
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:38,579
- My tie. I forgot my tie.
- Great, Bill. We're already late.

679
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:48,225
Hey, how you doing?
Ten bucks for your tie. Okay, 20.

680
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,768
Thirty. Come on, come on.
Thirty. Thirty bucks for that tie.

681
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,929
Where did you get that, Sears? Come on.
Help us out here. Would you? Please?

682
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,868
<i>You see, by that time,
Bill had already figured out... </i>

683
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:07,608
<i>... that we gotta go right into the belly of the
beast. The scariest beast of them all, IBM.</i>

684
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:13,120
<i>IBM. And back then, man, they were like
Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan... </i>

685
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,919
<i>... and Vlad the Impaler all rolled into one. </i>

686
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:21,258
<i>But what we were gonna do was,
we were gonna make them love us. </i>

687
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,763
Gentlemen, how are you? Nice tie.

688
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,925
- Thanks.
- We're over here.

689
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,533
Our shirts are as white as theirs.

690
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,209
We think we have what you need.

691
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,211
That's a start.

692
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,477
Now, we know that IBM has set up
this place to compete head-on with Apple...

693
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:46,885
...and you're gearing up to come out with a
personal computer that will wipe them out.

694
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,116
So we can get you an operating system.

695
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,420
What kind of operating system?

696
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,359
It's called...

697
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,328
...DOS.

698
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,899
This is amazing.
Not just amazing, it's historic.

699
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,404
It should be taught
in all the history books.

700
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,839
I mean, hung and framed
in the National Gallery or something.

701
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,673
Because this is the instant of creation...

702
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,112
...of one of the greatest fortunes
in the history of the world.

703
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:19,916
I mean, Bill Gates is the richest guy in the
world because of what started in this room.

704
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,523
You wanna know what else?

705
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:25,685
It wasn't exactly smoke and mirrors,
but we didn't have anything.

706
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:29,593
I mean, not a damn thing.

707
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,261
Here we were, this two-bit little outfit...

708
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,395
...telling IBM we had the answer
to their problems.

709
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,337
DOS? The Disk Operating System?

710
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:43,240
To make all those zillion
IBM computers compute?

711
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:47,509
We didn't even remotely own
anything like what Bill was selling them.

712
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,016
<i>Nada, zip.</i>

713
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,925
Of course, we don't just
wanna sell it to you outright.

714
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,086
We wanna be able to license it to you.

715
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,596
- You want to retain ownership?
- Right.

716
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:10,432
Well, the profits are in the computers
themselves, not this software stuff.

717
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,469
No big deal.

718
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,374
Oh, and one other thing.

719
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,708
We have to be able...

720
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,374
...to sell it to other outfits.

721
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,952
But...

722
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:30,958
...there was just one little problem.

723
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,754
Bill, why did you tell them
we have an operating system?

724
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,560
We don't have a thing to sell them now.
We're dead.

725
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:42,831
- We're not. You'll give us the miracle, right?
- Oh, yeah, right.

726
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,635
Well, come on. You said you knew a guy
we could buy an operating system from.

727
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,801
I said I sort of know him.

728
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:52,142
Sort of? You heard me.
Don't tell me "sort of. " I just told IBM.

729
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,583
Sort of.

730
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,153
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

731
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:23,101
So basically, you're saying
you wanna buy my operating system.

732
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,508
Yeah.

733
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,714
Why?

734
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:40,797
You know, I don't know. We just think we
might be able to mess with it and resell it.

735
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,192
Who to?

736
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,129
We have a few customers, you know,
we're sort of talking to.

737
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,827
Some of them don't want it known
what we're doing.

738
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:51,405
So they made us sign
a secrecy agreement.

739
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,409
- And you're offering us...?
- Fifty thousand.

740
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,345
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

741
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:08,819
You worried?

742
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:12,052
Oh, no. Only my whole life hangs
in the balance. Me, worried? No.

743
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,328
We got IBM.

744
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,990
IBM. I mean, come to think of it...

745
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,660
...why would IBM wanna make a deal
with a bunch of bozos like us?

746
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,829
Because they're successful, Ballmer.

747
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:27,602
Success is a menace. It fools smart people
into thinking they can't lose.

748
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,788
So?

749
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,221
So, you mute moron?

750
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,275
<i>Can you hear it? The sound of money?</i>

751
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,304
<i>The roar of money. It was like everywhere
you turned, money poured down. </i>

752
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,417
<i>Millions and more millions. </i>

753
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:13,045
<i>All because we bought that guy's
operating system for a measly 50,000 bucks. </i>

754
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:18,718
<i>That fueled a worldwide explosion of wealth
unlike anything in the history of man. </i>

755
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,159
<i>But you know something?</i>

756
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:26,428
<i>Having money and being cool
are not necessarily the same thing. </i>

757
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,901
- Hi, I'm Bill Gates...
- Hey.

758
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,739
What in the...?

759
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,640
Hi.

760
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,646
You know, you should really watch
where you're going.

761
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,183
You must have really great bandwidth.

762
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,285
- Excuse me?
- What are you doing later?

763
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,083
Who is that jerk?

764
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,260
Way to go, hotshot.

765
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,866
When Paul and I were at Lakeside,
we were in 10th grade together...

766
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,372
...we rigged a computer so we could
get classes with all the best girls.

767
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,477
Obviously, it's been downhill since then.

768
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,274
You should walk around with your bankbook
hanging from a chain on your belt.

769
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:15,976
Or maybe you ought to stop yelling
in front of your employees.

770
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:19,178
Girls don't like yelling. They like cool.

771
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,984
Oh, really, Ballmer?
How do you get to be cool?

772
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,661
<i>I don't know. You saw
Saturday Night Fever. Travolta's cool.</i>

773
00:54:54,357 --> 00:55:00,023
I'd like to welcome all of you to the new
headquarters and home of Apple Computers.

774
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,391
<i>All of a sudden, Steve was a huge star. </i>

775
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,329
<i>The kind where people practically
hang on your every word... </i>

776
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,902
<i>... like they're excited
just to be around you. </i>

777
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:12,007
Thank you very much
for joining us today on this lovely day...

778
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,803
...and helping us stop the gossip rumors
in their tracks.

779
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,843
Without further ado,
the rumors are true.

780
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,504
Ladies and gentlemen,
our new president, John Sculley.

781
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:29,457
To tell you the truth, I was perfectly happy
to be president of Pepsi-Cola...

782
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:33,118
...until Steve Jobs came to recruit me
and said:

783
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,094
"Do you wanna sell sugared water
for the rest of your life...

784
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,858
...or do you wanna make history?"

785
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

786
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,229
- I know.
- Yeah, operator.

787
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:46,432
- I need information for Oregon.
- Okay, give me a minute.

788
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,311
Steve, I gotta talk. I don't know how
to act in situations like this.

789
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,180
- In a minute.
- I mean, Steve, that stock-offering thing?

790
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,582
A hundred million dollars?

791
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,916
- What do you do with $ 116 million?
- In a minute.

792
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:05,050
I don't think rich, okay? I know a lot of
people think rich, but I don't think rich.

793
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:09,255
I mean, maybe you learn it, but, jeez,
$ 100 million. That's a lot of learning to do.

794
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,424
I hardly ever had enough for lunch
before all this.

795
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,603
We should have given stock
to the other guys, Steve.

796
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,434
Like Dan?
Dan's been with us since we started...

797
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,304
...and you didn't set aside
any stock for him.

798
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,107
Steve.

799
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,713
- I'm gonna give Dan some of my stock.
- Yeah, is Arlene there?

800
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,580
We gotta do the right thing.

801
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,418
<i>Arlene? Okay, fine. 
Let's talk about this baby. </i>

802
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,821
Steve, why do you care
what I call the baby?

803
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:40,053
Because I don't want
the baby named Rainbow.

804
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,257
Or Orisha or Ravi Shankar
or any other name like that.

805
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,368
Steve, not right now, okay?

806
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:51,200
<i>Well, when the hell is a good time to call?
Because every time I try...</i>

807
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,840
Steve.

808
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,261
- Do you want me to take that?
- Thank you.

809
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,124
You're welcome.

810
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,855
Hi.

811
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,947
Hi.

812
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,764
So I just came by to make sure
everything's okay.

813
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,794
- Everything okay?
- Thank you.

814
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,807
And to...

815
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:43,248
...make sure that you're not
gonna name it some weird name.

816
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,950
What's wrong with naming her Orisha?

817
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,953
Or Sunshine or Purity?

818
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,088
A kid's got enough problems
in this world...

819
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,292
...not knowing where it belongs.

820
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,993
A name can label a kid.

821
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:03,629
Make it...

822
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,172
It can make it an outsider.

823
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,434
Not "it. "

824
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,839
Her.

825
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,638
Her.

826
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,685
Lisa.

827
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,260
Okay.

828
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,224
Okay.

829
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,106
She's your daughter too.

830
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,374
Arlene, let's not go through that again.

831
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,551
You don't just live in life.

832
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:04,393
You change it, you shape it,
you make your mark upon it.

833
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,662
And that's what, get used to the name...

834
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,238
...Lisa is gonna do.

835
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,635
Yeah!

836
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,210
<i>You know, that computer was
the first big new project we had at Apple. </i>

837
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:20,577
<i>And some people are still wondering
why Steve insisted on that name. </i>

838
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,586
You wanna call a computer Lisa?

839
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,778
Isn't that your baby's...?

840
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,685
I mean...

841
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:33,591
What's her name? Arlene.
Isn't that Arlene's baby's name?

842
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,493
Other guys here
have daughters named Lisa.

843
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:41,035
Steve, you got a baby up there
you don't even wanna talk about.

844
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:46,034
- I mean, it looks sort of...
- Sort of what?

845
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,186
We have to think of ourselves as artists.

846
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,754
It's like Picasso said:

847
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:06,622
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

848
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,598
<i>This is who we wanted
to steal from. Xerox. </i>

849
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,293
<i>They were secretly developing
all this amazing stuff... </i>

850
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:18,338
<i>... like the mouse and the graphics on the
screen instead of just a bunch of numbers. </i>

851
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,341
<i>But when those California engineers
had to go to New York... </i>

852
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,105
<i>... and present all this neat stuff
to the Xerox brass... </i>

853
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,772
<i>... those executives didn't begin
to understand what they were looking at. </i>

854
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:33,547
<i>Never mind a mouse. It was like someone
dumped a dead rat on the boardroom table. </i>

855
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,994
A mouse.

856
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,331
You want Xerox to consider
something called a mouse?

857
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,812
<i>See, this is where Steve was a genius... </i>

858
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:03,577
<i>... because he persuaded Xerox
into showing us all this incredible stuff... </i>

859
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,550
<i>... their California guys had developed. </i>

860
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,350
<i>I tell you, it was making their people
absolutely nuts. </i>

861
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,488
Oh, God.

862
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,032
Let's go.

863
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,761
<i>You know, I felt like
one of the Mongol hordes... </i>

864
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:24,668
<i>... coming to loot and plunder
a bunch of defenseless villagers. </i>

865
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,440
No, no. This is insane.

866
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,739
We'd just be handing him everything.

867
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:37,079
We created the mouse and all the rest of it,
and now these idiots in New York...

868
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,278
...want to show it all to Steve Jobs.

869
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,820
I won't do it.

870
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,982
Hi. I'm Steve Jobs.

871
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:50,130
I need you to answer some other questions
about the stuff you've invented.

872
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,290
The graphic interface?

873
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,568
It's not going to hurt.

874
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:58,506
That's what you think.

875
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,067
- What do you want to know?
- How does it...?

876
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,942
What is your base length?
Is it integer, or is it compound?

877
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,640
Does your operating system
convert to executable codes?

878
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,254
- I got it. I got it, Steve-O. I got it, Steve-O.
- What is the middle...?

879
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,020
It's pretty neat, right?

880
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,790
Click, you're there.

881
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,191
Click, you're somewhere else.

882
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:29,429
This graphic interface stuff was like
a miracle back then, and we got it.

883
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:33,769
Steve got it, from Xerox, who just
turned it all over for us to fool with.

884
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:37,401
Like rich people giving junky old stuff
to the Salvation Army...

885
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,879
...only the junk turns out
to be a Rembrandt.

886
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,611
About $ 100 billion head start
on everyone else.

887
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,416
Apple was making tons of money.
It was great.

888
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:53,290
And of course, I sort of lost my mind.
I mean, it was all fun and games.

889
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:56,056
I started buying really expensive toys.

890
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,300
<i>It was me with my own plane. </i>

891
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,996
<i>Only problem was, maybe I wasn't
as good a pilot as I thought I was. </i>

892
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,404
<i>I mean, it's one thing
when computers crash, but planes?</i>

893
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:08,805
<i>You don't want to know. </i>

894
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,586
Hey, Steve. Are you just getting here?

895
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,984
No, I was just outside
talking to the doctor.

896
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,557
You don't remember us
talking 10 minutes ago?

897
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,557
- We talked?
- Yeah.

898
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,889
Hey, my hard disk crashed.

899
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,428
A computer guy with memory problems.

900
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,271
Oh, man.

901
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,637
It's the weirdest thing.
You know there's a part of your life there...

902
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,778
...only you don't know about it.

903
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,311
It makes you crazy.

904
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,492
Hey.

905
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,929
Hey!

906
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,663
Paul.

907
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,329
Simonyi, get Matthews.

908
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,441
Ballmer, get in here.

909
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,438
- What is it?
- This is seriously crummy.

910
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,175
Apple's new computer, Lisa? We're dead.

911
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,909
Oh, yeah, I've already seen one.

912
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,350
The graphics and the operating system
they have...

913
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:29,355
...they make what we're selling IBM
look a decade out-of-date.

914
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:31,652
- I want it.
- What do you mean, you want it?

915
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:37,163
- It's Apple's. We can't just go and steal it.
- You're not listening to me. I want it.

916
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:43,829
<i>Final call for TWA flight 2684
to San Jose. Final call. </i>

917
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,533
- Fifty bucks he misses the flight.
- You're on.

918
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,679
It wouldn't hurt to buy a car radio, Bill.

919
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,076
- I can't pick up the radio...
- One traffic report.

920
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,740
- Hold on.
- Sir, we're on this plane.

921
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:58,751
I'm sorry. Your plane is on the runway.

922
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,980
Ma'am, what kind of service
is this today?

923
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:05,093
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing that can bring
that plane back to the gate.

924
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,924
Yes, there is. Willpower. I'm going to will
that that plane be turned around.

925
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,191
- Oh, really?
- Really, sir.

926
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:15,167
Are you aware that today in my briefcase
are computer language codes?

927
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,932
- Do you know what they do, sir?
- I'm afraid I don't.

928
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:21,167
They protect against viruses.
You're aware of viruses, I presume?

929
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:25,713
- Sir, I do go to doctors.
- No, sir, computer viruses.

930
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:28,281
Oh, yeah, I just read an article
about those things.

931
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,477
- They can wipe out a whole computer.
- A whole system of computers.

932
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,851
Like the one behind your terminal there,
like the one in the plane...

933
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:39,222
...like the one on all planes in the airlines,
like the one in the control tower, sir.

934
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:42,694
I ask you, are you prepared
to take responsibility for your actions...

935
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,891
...if I don't get this information
on that plane?

936
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,939
Jeez, his reputation for inconveniencing
the rest of the world is intact.

937
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,803
He actually missed a flight.

938
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:57,742
<i>This is your captain speaking. We have
to return to the gate for a few minutes. </i>

939
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,211
<i>Nothing critical. </i>

940
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:10,523
<i>- Attention, please, flight... 
- Your tickets, please.</i>

941
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,959
- You have the tickets, right?
- No, I gave them to you.

942
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,464
Bill, in the car.

943
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:38,280
Wow. These guys must be
50 times bigger than we are.

944
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,446
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

945
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:45,116
- Oh, yeah? Who said that?
- Some artist. I think it was Van Gogh.

946
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:49,296
Hey, check it out.

947
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,794
Aye, matey. It wouldn't be time
to rape and pillage, would it?

948
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,814
You sure it's okay
to let these Microsoft guys in here?

949
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:10,051
We have culture. They don't.

950
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:13,480
No taste. No original thinking.

951
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,421
But they can be useful to us.

952
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,823
Time for the dog and pony show.

953
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,237
Welcome to Apple.

954
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,179
Bill.

955
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,320
Nice to see you. Thanks for coming.
Steve.

956
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,390
- How you doing, Steve?
- Glad you're here. Paul. Hi, Steve Jobs.

957
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,118
- Hi. Charles Simonyi.
- Come on in. Let me introduce you.

958
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,888
This is Gilmore.
He's one of our top programmers.

959
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,025
And he's a loyal man.
Well, to do this, you need loyalty.

960
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:02,098
- Total loyalty. Isn't that right?
- That's the plan, Steve.

961
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:07,309
This way. The Macintosh team.
It's more like a family.

962
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,309
Everybody else is an outsider.

963
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,676
- What's with the pirate stuff?
- What do I always tell you?

964
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,209
Better to be a pirate than join the Navy.

965
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:19,548
- You a pirate?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely, Steve.

966
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,885
I've been up for 52 hours straight.

967
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:24,754
Loyalty.

968
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,494
I'm gonna show you the future.

969
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:39,300
It's top-secret. It's still about...

970
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,273
...a year away from introduction.

971
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,645
The ultimate, insanely great...

972
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,411
...fusion of art and science.

973
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:55,150
- It's called the Macintosh.
- This is definitely not the Lisa.

974
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,554
That's a graphic user interface.

975
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:01,457
I don't understand. How does a computer
handle the mouse-cursor display?

976
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,621
Hardware's got nothing to do
with the mouse.

977
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:06,097
- It's all in the software.
- Enough.

978
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,463
Sorry, Steve.

979
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:12,329
There's no point in torturing our guests...

980
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,309
...with what they can't have.

981
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:26,283
You're vulnerable in spreadsheets,
you know, Steve.

982
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,719
We can help you.

983
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,790
Ninety hours a week. Like the T-shirt?
I'm gonna give it to my people.

984
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,894
Some of them work even more
than 90 hours a week.

985
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,969
We have Multiplan running on
dozens of different platforms.

986
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,298
No one can match us.

987
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,473
You can't just have employees anymore.

988
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,270
It's great.

989
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,305
No, they gotta be into a crusade.

990
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:58,181
It's like art, science, religion,
all rolled into one.

991
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:02,415
We have multi-tool interface.
It can be redesigned for the Mac.

992
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:06,254
Redesigned. Redesigned.

993
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:09,090
We're artists here.

994
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,893
A place where raw sand
comes in one end...

995
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:16,197
...and goes out the other. Silicon art.

996
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:23,039
You know, IBM, they're gonna want
all our stuff.

997
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,178
IBM?

998
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:30,144
IBM, they're history.

999
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:35,757
I mean, they're 1950s, they're ice America,
a bloated enemy in a crumbling castle.

1000
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,722
- And we're storming it.
- I know IBM is the enemy, Steve.

1001
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,089
But we can help you.

1002
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,564
You don't have to worry about IBM.

1003
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,234
Yeah?

1004
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,427
So why you even working with them?

1005
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,766
I'd much rather work with you.

1006
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,549
We're in.

1007
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,280
- We're doing work for Apple.
- You're kidding me.

1008
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,390
They're sending us three prototypes
of the computer we just saw.

1009
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,048
- The Macintosh.
- For God sakes.

1010
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,992
There's a pirate flag flying above our heads,
and he's giving us the crown jewel?

1011
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,791
Who the hell's the pirate here?

1012
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,297
He sees what he believes,
not the other way around.

1013
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,265
We're not his worst problem.

1014
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:24,201
If he's not careful,
he's gonna wreck the place.

1015
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,437
- Macintosh! Macintosh!
- Macintosh rules!

1016
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,544
- Apple II's the best!
- Mac's the best!

1017
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:33,978
<i>Even when I got my memory back,
it was never the same for me. </i>

1018
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,117
<i>I couldn't believe
how it had all changed. </i>

1019
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,412
<i>Apple was tearing itself to pieces. </i>

1020
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,581
<i>Steve had turned it into two camps:</i>

1021
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:46,285
<i>His new Macintosh group
against everyone else in the company. </i>

1022
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,128
Steve, what the hell is this?

1023
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:57,469
It's like a family. Things get messy.

1024
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,238
I don't understand this.

1025
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,571
You got the Mac people
against the Apple II people?

1026
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,838
- They're beating each other up.
- Amazing, huh?

1027
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,449
People wanna be shaped, molded.

1028
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:11,347
But if you asked any of them,
any of them, they'd deny it.

1029
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:16,288
I don't wanna shape anybody, Steve.
This isn't fun anymore.

1030
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:20,019
Maybe fun is just fragments of existence
with better packaging.

1031
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,397
I don't make jokes anymore.

1032
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:27,399
I told you a long time ago, I like jokes.

1033
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:32,836
Steve! Goodbye. I'm quitting Apple.

1034
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:38,978
- Well, that's a joke, right?
- No. I'm going back to college.

1035
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:44,950
Woz. Hey, what are you doing?
I don't think it's such a good idea.

1036
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,022
All I'm doing now is being a brake pedal
for you as you're heading for the wall.

1037
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,857
Woz!

1038
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,260
- I ask you for brilliance?
- Steve.

1039
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:31,388
I've asked you for genius,
and you're giving me this?

1040
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,602
Steve, please.

1041
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,577
Oh, no, Steve, not again.

1042
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:51,708
It's 3 a. m., okay? I don't have the energy
to defend an unfinished design.

1043
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:55,414
That's because there's nothing to defend.

1044
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:59,925
I want beauty, not incompetence.

1045
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,721
Are you listening to me?

1046
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,365
- Are you listening...?
- Yes, I'm listening!

1047
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,627
I am so sick of your abusiveness.

1048
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,998
That's all you know.
Tearing people down, throwing tantrums.

1049
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:17,578
- You miserable son of a bitch.
- What are you doing? Come on, back off.

1050
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,953
<i>I know we've been in a battle... </i>

1051
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,657
...and like all battles,
we've had our casualties along the way.

1052
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,163
But today's about celebrating.

1053
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:44,662
The Macintosh.

1054
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,214
It's time for a christening...

1055
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,814
...of our little Macintosh.

1056
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,886
Our baby.

1057
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,394
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1058
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,969
Real artists ship.

1059
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,898
In this company, in Apple,
in the entire business...

1060
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:25,809
...we, you, the Macintosh team,
are the only true artists.

1061
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,677
You can forget Apple, forget Lisa.

1062
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,377
It's only us. The Macintosh team.

1063
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:35,387
We have been chosen to seize history.

1064
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:42,458
But first, carpe diem, seize the day.
It's your time to party, people.

1065
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,791
Hey, John.

1066
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,027
You hear what I heard in there?

1067
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:21,034
- Hey, man, what'd you say about Steve?
- I'm sick of his crap.

1068
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,068
- What'd you say, man?
- You heard me.

1069
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,433
You wanna talk like that about Steve?

1070
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:28,269
You wanna talk like that about the guy
who feeds you, man?

1071
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:32,345
- The guy who feeds you?
- Come on. Break it up.

1072
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,311
Come on.

1073
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:38,218
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Somebody pull him off.

1074
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,487
- Never like this at Pepsi-Cola.
- Knock it off.

1075
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,755
You wanna sell sugar water
the rest of your life?

1076
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,370
Steve, I'm worried.

1077
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,277
Yeah?

1078
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:07,142
Yeah, about what's happening.

1079
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:12,212
All the, you know, "them versus us" stuff.
Macintosh versus Apple II.

1080
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:15,845
You don't understand, John.
People need a cause.

1081
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,391
We missed Vietnam. This is our Vietnam.

1082
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:24,292
- It's tearing the company apart.
- Creation is messy.

1083
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:27,264
You want genius, you get madness.
Two sides of the same coin.

1084
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,529
You knew that when I brought you in.

1085
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,265
Steve, if you can't trust me,
then God help you.

1086
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,433
I didn't mention anything
about trust, John.

1087
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,378
There's another problem.

1088
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,544
- It's Arlene and the baby.
- That's my business.

1089
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:49,782
<i>No, not anymore.
TIME magazine is doing another story.</i>

1090
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,222
You don't need the bad press.
Neither do we.

1091
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,329
- Child's not mine.
- Steve, come on. You took a paternity test.

1092
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,598
She is yours.
It's right there in the results.

1093
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:03,261
- Paternity tests are a joke.
- She's asking for $20,000.

1094
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:05,838
- Total, nothing more.
- Blackmail.

1095
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,976
Steve, you can afford the money.
Give her what she's asking for.

1096
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,874
- You should give her more.
- It's not about the damn money.

1097
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,409
Well, what is it, then?

1098
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,676
I don't know.

1099
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,400
Mommy, there's a man here.

1100
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:31,620
It's been what, a year?

1101
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:38,588
- Yeah, I've been busy.
- I'm sure.

1102
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:44,704
- Why'd you come?
- I don't know.

1103
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,641
She's looking really good.

1104
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,383
You should have come to see her.

1105
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:01,613
- You could have brought her by.
- Oh, Steve.

1106
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:06,260
Here.

1107
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,405
Thank you.

1108
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,998
Thank you, Lisa.

1109
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,680
- Steve Jobs is killing us. Ballmer!
- Yeah?

1110
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,817
This stuff is crummy. It's totally crummy.

1111
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,817
- Windows was supposed to ship last year.
- We're ready for you.

1112
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,455
Why do I have to do this?
I have work. This is stupid.

1113
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,750
<i>It's good PR.
It's for The Wall Street Journal.</i>

1114
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,656
- I don't need PR.
- Can you stand a little to the left?

1115
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:17,264
The hole in that sweater of your shirt.
Turn all the way to the right.

1116
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,024
What am I, a trained seal?

1117
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,363
- Lf Apple can do this, why can't we?
- What do you want us to do?

1118
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,664
- Whatever you have to.
- Meaning what, Bill?

1119
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,966
Meaning ship Windows
before the snow falls.

1120
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:29,736
- This is Seattle. It doesn't snow here.
- Whatever, Steve.

1121
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,379
Mr. Gates, I think you should
take off your sweater...

1122
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,674
...because it clashes
with the background.

1123
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,010
The green and blue,
it's just not in these days.

1124
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,176
It's not in at all.

1125
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:42,790
Sweat stains. This is awful.

1126
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:52,397
- I'd like to get back to work...
- I know, we're almost ready.

1127
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:58,870
Okay, and three, two, one.
Smile, please.

1128
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,868
Urgent, Mr. Gates.

1129
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:04,807
Thank you. What's next?

1130
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,078
Steve Jobs.

1131
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,180
"Mr. Jobs demands you be
in his office tonight. "

1132
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:14,845
He's getting paranoid
over what we're doing.

1133
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,621
Maybe he should be.

1134
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:19,917
Not at the pace you're going.

1135
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,086
I think I had a date tonight with Ann.

1136
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:24,288
- I thought she was away on business.
- She is.

1137
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,024
Then how can you have a date?

1138
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:30,001
Well, I go to a movie here, and then
she goes to the same movie in Denver...

1139
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,799
...and then we talk on the phone
about it afterwards.

1140
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:37,138
Jeez, Bill, I hate to see what happens
when you two have sex.

1141
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,480
You're stealing from us!

1142
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:29,460
Steve, we're not stealing from you.
So don't tell me that.

1143
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,460
What the hell are you doing, then?

1144
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:37,094
What is this that I keep hearing
about you developing this...?

1145
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,866
What do you call it? Windows?

1146
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,373
To compete with us?

1147
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:49,315
- I'm not doing anything against you, Steve.
- Don't give me that crap!

1148
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,783
You're pirating the software
off our Mac prototypes!

1149
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:54,615
I trusted you.

1150
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:59,627
If you wanna know everything
we're working on, I'll show you.

1151
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,567
<i>The weird thing was... </i>

1152
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,433
<i>... Steve Jobs was the one guy
Bill would never yell at. It was the opposite. </i>

1153
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,838
<i>Steve would order Bill to fly down there
and then blow up at him... </i>

1154
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:19,707
<i>... but Bill, he would just wait it out,
convince Steve that we were no threat... </i>

1155
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:23,476
<i>... that this Windows stuff was just
that much more smoke and mirrors... </i>

1156
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,915
<i>... and a few hours later,
everything was fine. </i>

1157
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,146
<i>I'm telling you, Bill's a genius at it. </i>

1158
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:31,688
And that's all you're working on?

1159
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,388
Of course.

1160
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,593
- Yeah?
- You know what else?

1161
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:40,493
Did you read what I said in that
newspaper story on us two days ago?

1162
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,961
- No. What'd you say?
- I said when your Macintosh comes out...

1163
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:47,006
...that'd be the only computer
I'd want to buy my mom.

1164
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,605
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1165
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:52,671
Your mom, huh?

1166
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:57,284
- It's like we're one big family, you know?
- Family?

1167
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:01,349
You know that.

1168
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,786
Family.

1169
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:11,355
<i>Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve!</i>

1170
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,570
Tell me something.

1171
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:29,911
When did this stop being a business
and start being a religion?

1172
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,483
Thank you for your work.

1173
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:36,522
And remember, what we will do
in the next year...

1174
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,717
...will change the way people think...

1175
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:42,192
...and communicate.

1176
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,597
Hey.

1177
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,429
- Hey.
- So enjoy the revolution...

1178
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:52,061
...which we have all created and watch...

1179
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,105
You know, Steve thinks IBM's the enemy.

1180
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,606
- Unfolds in front of us.

1181
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,041
He doesn't get it.

1182
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,908
You guys are.

1183
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,043
What are you talking about?

1184
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,950
Copies of your Windows
just started surfacing here.

1185
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:09,612
You took our stuff, Bill.

1186
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:13,192
You took our stuff, you fooled with it,
and you called it your own.

1187
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,627
You always insult your guests like this?

1188
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,528
Make no mistake.

1189
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:25,503
We are all one big family.

1190
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:29,602
And part of it
are our friends at Microsoft.

1191
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,342
Bill?

1192
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:43,957
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Gates.

1193
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,459
Finally, I wanna show you a preview...

1194
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:55,296
...of the most amazing 60 seconds of film
you'll ever see.

1195
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,700
And we're showing it only once...

1196
01:27:57,872 --> 01:27:59,362
...during the Super Bowl.

1197
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,737
So watch and see how we handle IBM.

1198
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,838
I mean Big Brother.

1199
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,877
<i>See, that commercial was interesting
in a lot of ways... </i>

1200
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:15,022
<i>... because when we're at
this big hoopla at Apple... </i>

1201
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:18,920
<i>... and their engineers are unpacking
all these Japanese computers... </i>

1202
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:21,618
<i>... with the first copies
of our stuff, Windows... </i>

1203
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,061
<i>... that looks a lot like their stuff... </i>

1204
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,224
<i>I mean, if I had to pick a moment... </i>

1205
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,007
Hey...

1206
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,842
...I'm getting
some pretty weird vibes here.

1207
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:43,881
Sure we should stay around?

1208
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:49,112
Sometimes you deal them.
Sometimes you fold them.

1209
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,326
Now's not the time to fold.

1210
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:58,390
<i>We shall prevail. </i>

1211
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:06,573
I obviously made a mistake.

1212
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,872
I made a mistake.

1213
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,373
I trusted.

1214
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,580
I believed.

1215
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:21,317
Family.

1216
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:27,621
Maybe a Mafia family.
You turn your back, and you get whacked.

1217
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:32,129
Our guys come back from Japan
with this NEC...

1218
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:37,729
...and it's loaded with Microsoft programs.
Your Microsoft programs.

1219
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:40,567
They're almost identical to ours.

1220
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:46,475
There may be some similarities, Steve.

1221
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,178
Similarities?

1222
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,955
Similarities?

1223
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:02,094
- Try theft.
- Steve, all cars have steering wheels...

1224
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:05,664
...but no one tries to claim
that the steering wheel was their invention.

1225
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:09,929
- We have a contract, you and I.
- Well, you should read it more carefully.

1226
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,935
What is this?

1227
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,807
This is like doing business with...

1228
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,238
...like, a praying mantis.

1229
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,471
You get seduced
and then eaten alive afterwards.

1230
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,974
Get real, will you?

1231
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:27,849
You and I are both like guys
that have this rich neighbor...

1232
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:30,115
...Xerox...

1233
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:32,589
...that left the door open all the time.

1234
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,627
And you go sneaking in
to steal the TV set.

1235
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:40,330
Only when you get there,
you realize that I got there first.

1236
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,867
I got the loot, Steve!

1237
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,401
And you're yelling?

1238
01:30:45,573 --> 01:30:48,201
"That's not fair.

1239
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:51,470
I wanted to try to steal it first. "

1240
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,245
You're too late.

1241
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:08,092
We're better than you are.

1242
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,964
- We have better stuff.
- You don't get it, Steve.

1243
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:20,633
That doesn't matter.

1244
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:42,724
<i>You know, like a lot of things,
there always seems to be one last time. </i>

1245
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:45,127
<i>For us, it was when we all
came together again... </i>

1246
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:48,029
<i>... for this big party
Steve threw for his 30th birthday. </i>

1247
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,227
<i>It was just one of those things. </i>

1248
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:53,202
<i>You know, where you try really hard
to make something work... </i>

1249
01:31:53,374 --> 01:31:55,672
<i>... but somehow it just doesn't. </i>

1250
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:58,971
<i>And maybe you should have known it
all along. </i>

1251
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:06,477
- Is that really Ella Fitzgerald?
- I have absolutely no idea.

1252
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:11,657
You hear the kind of food
they're serving?

1253
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:14,420
- Salmon mousse, goat's cheese.
- I can't eat that stuff.

1254
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:17,826
- Why don't we go to Denny's?
- Is that Joan Baez with him?

1255
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,796
Wait, wait. Who's Joan Baez?

1256
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:23,162
- Hi.
- John.

1257
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,942
I need to talk to you. It's important.

1258
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,411
Okay, John. Excuse me.

1259
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:42,547
We've got a problem.
We've been asked to make a toast to Steve.

1260
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:47,126
Me? Toast Steve? No way, man.
Not after what's happened. No way.

1261
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:51,254
Oh, John, don't look at me. L...
Mike, you do it.

1262
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:55,027
After the past few months?
I don't think so.

1263
01:32:55,636 --> 01:32:58,503
John, you're the one.

1264
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:02,632
- No. Not now. Absolutely no way.
- Why not?

1265
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,979
- Look, Steve thinks I'm his...
- He thinks you're what?

1266
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,885
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.

1267
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:21,218
To a remarkable man.

1268
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:23,226
A man who brought me
to this company...

1269
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:26,962
...without whom none of this tonight
would ever have happened.

1270
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:31,730
Steve Jobs, truly a guiding light.
A man who sees the future.

1271
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:33,134
- Hear, hear!
- Steve.

1272
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:34,604
Happy birthday!

1273
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:44,339
It's weird, but sometimes you find things
that are more important to you...

1274
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:48,352
...than the things you think are important.
You know what I mean?

1275
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,355
Maybe it's just getting older.

1276
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:57,325
Okay, guys. Let's see how we did.

1277
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,927
That's a good one.

1278
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:13,370
It's true.

1279
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:18,708
We're learning about the size of the sun
versus the size of the Earth.

1280
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:32,465
<i>Hi, Steve. </i>

1281
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:36,399
<i>I think it's gonna be really interesting,
I mean, you and me together. </i>

1282
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:38,635
Yeah.

1283
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:42,599
It is.
